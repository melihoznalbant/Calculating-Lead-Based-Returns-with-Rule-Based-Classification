# Calculating-Lead-Based-Returns-with-Rule-Based-Classification

I analyzed the case of Calculating Lead-Based Returns with Rule-Based Classification, which forms the basis of financial analysis, and complete various tasks. I will use Persona data and complete my analysis on this data.


Dataset Story:
The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.

Price: Customer spend amount

Sex: Customer's gender
